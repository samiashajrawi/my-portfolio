            digital experiences and leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve
            complex problems. I'm always looking for opportunities to innovate
            and drive impactful projects forward. If you're looking for someone

                Create a voice translation assistant using Watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed.
                The guided project takes you through
                building a translation assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the
                text to Watsonx's flan-ul2 model, receive a
                response in other languages, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.
                The voice translator will have a responsive
                frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable backend using Flask.
